To train an agent to play flappy bird game perfectly, used genetic algoritm and neural networks. 

NeuralNetwork.cs and Matrix.cs libraries are my own codes.

### Setup
- Create a Unity Project
- Add all files to Assets
- Double cl√ßk to game scene in Scenes folder
- If you want to change how many birds generate in each generation, you can easily change the noOfBirds parameter in Controller.cs file, or clicking to AI game object in Hierarchy window you will see noOfBirds part.
- Then you can start the game to train the agent
